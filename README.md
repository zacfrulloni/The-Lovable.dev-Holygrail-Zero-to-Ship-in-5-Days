*A simple, story-style path from idea to live app (with copy-paste prompts).*

> I quit my 9‚Äì5 after building 20+ Lovable MVPs and earning $29k in 5 months. Here‚Äôs the 5-day loop I still use.

## Why this exists

Most builders spend weeks scaffolding. This playbook compresses it into **5 focused days** with a PRD, prompts, and guardrails so you can ship a paid-ready MVP fast (auth, core features, Stripe, SEO, deploy).

## Day 1 ‚Äì Problems to PRD to Skeleton

### Find a real problem
- Collect 3‚Äì5 pain screenshots (Reddit, Discord, YouTube/TikTok comments).
- Write a 10-word ‚Äúvalue moment.‚Äù

### Write a PRD Lovable will follow
- Names, exact routes, user stories with single acceptance checks, and states.
- Keep it human and specific.

### Generate the skeleton in Lovable
- Use a skeleton-only prompt (routes, nav, placeholders, empty/loading/error).
- No auth or data yet.

### Verify
- Every PRD route exists.
- Labels match exactly.
- Empty/loading/error visible.

**PRD kickstart prompt**
You will create a PRD I can paste into lovable.dev.
Ask 5‚Äì8 clarifying questions in one list, wait for answers.

Then produce:

Project summary (~50w)

Pages (exact routes + 1-line purpose)

Core features (6‚Äì8 user stories + 1 acceptance check each)

Data objects (names + 3‚Äì5 behaviors; no fields)

UX flow (happy path + one empty + one failure)

2-week plan (we‚Äôll compress to 5 days)

Copy (3 hero, 5 microcopy)

Skeleton Build Prompt

Constraints: non-technical language; consistent route names; no DB fields.

## Day 2 ‚Äì Finish core features

Connect Supabase in Lovable (top-right green icon). Build 1‚Äì2 core features guided by the PRD. Keep scope tiny and testable.

**Feature prompt**
Build a [FEATURE_NAME] for my [APP_TYPE]:

[Primary function]

[Key user action]

[Data requirement]

Create [ComponentName] with [specific UI elements].
Focus only on [main functionality] initially.
Do not change layout, auth, pricing, or route names.

yaml
Copy
Edit

**Verify**
- Action works end-to-end.  
- Refresh persists.  
- No unrelated changes.

---

## Day 3 ‚Äì Auth in two prompts

**Prompt A ‚Äì Login, Register, Reset**
Add Supabase authentication.

Do:

Login, Register, and Password Reset pages (match current design)

After login or registration, land on the main page from the PRD

A header user menu (email, Account/Settings link, Logout)

Friendly empty, loading, and error states

css
Copy
Edit

**Prompt B ‚Äì Email verification guard**
Require email verification before accessing the main app.

Do:

After registration, show a ‚Äúcheck your inbox‚Äù screen with a resend button

If an unverified user hits a protected page, show a blocker + resend

yaml
Copy
Edit

**Verify**
- Register ‚Üí verify ‚Üí login ‚Üí protected pages work.  
- Reset password OK.

---

## Day 4 ‚Äì Stripe + SEO for LLMs

### Stripe (test mode)
- Set plans, paywall, real-time status.  
- Use test clocks to simulate trials, renewals, cancellations.

**Stripe prompt**
Add Stripe subscriptions and a simple paywall.

Plans:

Basic $29/mo

Pro $290/yr

Requirements:

Update subscriber status in real time

Lock premium pages until subscription is active

### SEO for LLMs
- Sitemap, solid titles/descriptions.  
- Minimal JSON-LD.  
- 40‚Äì70 word ‚ÄúSummary‚Äù under H1.  
- Visible ‚ÄúUpdated YYYY-MM-DD.‚Äù  
- Canonical + OG/Twitter tags.  
- Optional /llms.txt index.

**JSON-LD prompt**
Add minimal JSON-LD:

Home: WebSite (name, url)

Pricing: Product + Offer (plan names, prices)

Guides: Article (headline, dateModified)

Render with <script type="application/ld+json"> matching visible content.

yaml

## Day 5 ‚Äì Clean deploy

**Option A**: Deploy inside Lovable with a custom domain.  
**Option B**: Push to GitHub ‚Üí Vercel/Netlify (dev/main branches).

**Final check**
- Routes match PRD.  
- Auth + Stripe pass.  
- SEO basics present.  
- Core flow demos in under 2 minutes.

**UI nit (Visual Edit)**

## FAQs

**Do I need Cursor?**  
Only if your app is complex. For most micro-SaaS, Lovable is enough.

**Will clients care that it‚Äôs AI-assisted?**  
Clients care about outcomes. Show a working product and clean code.

**How much time per day?**  
Plan 1‚Äì3 focused hours for 5 days. Short, scoped prompts beat marathons.
